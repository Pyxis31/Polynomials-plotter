# Polynomials-plotter
A little software to draw polynomials curves (poly 2,3,5) for seeing the shapes formed depending of the setting of the coefficients.
The original goal was to see that curves and its behavior and then to compute it within an omron SYSMAC controller to manage rightly
some industrials axis.
